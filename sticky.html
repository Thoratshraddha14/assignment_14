            Social media is a collection of websites and apps that allow users to communicate, share content, and collaborate. It has transformed how people connect, and is used for many purposes, including: 
            Staying in touch: Social media allows people to stay in touch with friends and family, even if they are far away. 
            Sharing information: Social media is a popular way to share information, opinions, and ideas. 
            Learning: Social media can be used for education, with students able to learn about a variety of topics.

            There are different views about the impact of social media on society, with some believing it has a negative influence and others believing it has positive outcomes. Some of the challenges of social media include the spread of fake news and rumors, but responsible use of social media can help to prevent this. 
            Mobile social media
            Mobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is distinguished by its ubiquity, since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer. Mobile services can further make use of the user's immediate location to offer information, connections, or services relevant to that location.

            According to Andreas Kaplan, mobile social media activities fall among four types:[28]

            Space-timers (location and time-sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance for a specific location at a specific point in time (posting about a traffic jam)
            Space-locators (only location sensitive): Posts/messages with relevance for a specific location, read later by others (e.g. a restaurant review)
            Quick-timers (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy (e.g. posting status updates)
            Slow-timers (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices (e.g. watching a video)
            Elements and function
           <h3>Virality</h3> 
            Main article: Viral phenomenon
            Certain content has the potential to spread virally, an analogy for the way viral infections spread contagiously from individual to individual. One user spreads a post across their network, which leads those users to follow suit. A post from a relatively unknown user can reach vast numbers of people within hours. Virality is not guaranteed; few posts make the transition.

            Viral marketing campaigns are particularly attractive to businesses because they can achieve widespread advertising coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns. Nonprofit organizations and activists may also attempt to spread content virally.

            Social media sites provide specific functionality to help users re-share content, such as X's and Facebook's "like" option.[29]

            Bots
            Main article: Internet bot
            Bots are automated programs that operate on the internet.[30] They automate many communication tasks. This has led to the creation of an industry of bot providers.[31]

            Chatbots and social bots are programmed to mimic human interactions such as liking, commenting, and following.[32] Bots have also been developed to facilitate social media marketing.[33] Bots have led the marketing industry into an analytical crisis, as bots make it difficult to differentiate between human interactions and bot interactions.[34] Some bots violate platforms' terms of use, which can result in bans and campaigns to eliminate bots categorically.[35] Bots may even pose as real people to avoid prohibitions.[36]

            'Cyborgs'—either bot-assisted humans or human-assisted bots[36]—are used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes, from spreading fake news to creating marketing buzz.[37][38][39] A common use claimed to be legitimate includes posting at a specific time.[40] A human writes a post content and the bot posts it a specific time. In other cases, cyborgs spread fake news.[36] Cyborgs may work as sock puppets, where one human pretends to be someone else, or operates multiple accounts, each pretending to be a person.

            <h3>Use by organizations</h3>
            Government
            Governments may use social media to (for example):[73]

            inform their opinions to public
            interact with citizens
            foster citizen participation
            further open government
            analyze/monitor public opinion and activities
            educate the public about risks and public health.[74]
            Law enforcement
            Social media has been used extensively in civil and criminal investigations.[75] It has also been used to search for missing persons.[76] Police departments often make use of official social media accounts to engage with the public, publicize police activity, and burnish law enforcement's image;[77][78] conversely, video footage of citizen-documented police brutality and other misconduct has sometimes been posted to social media.[78]

            In the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement identifies and track individuals via social media, and has apprehended some people via social media-based sting operations.[79] U.S. Customs and Border Protection (also known as CPB) and the United States Department of Homeland Security use social media data as influencing factors during the visa process, and monitor individuals after they have entered the country.[80] CPB officers have also been documented performing searches of electronics and social media behavior at the border, searching both citizens and non-citizens without first obtaining a warrant.[80]

            Reputation management
            As social media gained momentum among the younger generations, governments began using it to improve their image, especially among the youth. In January 2021, Egyptian authorities were reported to be using Instagram influencers as part of its media ambassadors program. The program was designed to revamp Egypt's image and to counter the bad press Egypt had received because of the country's human rights record. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates participated in similar programs.[81] Similarly, Dubai has extensively relied on social media and influencers to promote tourism. However, Dubai laws have kept these influencers within limits to not offend the authorities, or to criticize the city, politics or religion. The content of these foreign influencers is controlled to make sure that nothing portrays Dubai in a negative light.[82]

           <h3>Business</h3> 
            Main article: Social media use by businesses
            Many businesses use social media for marketing, branding,[83] advertising, communication, sales promotions, informal employee-learning/organizational development, competitive analysis, recruiting, relationship management/loyalty programs,[28] and e-Commerce. Companies use social-media monitoring tools to monitor, track, and analyze conversations to aid in their marketing, sales and other programs. Tools range from free, basic applications to subscription-based, tools. Social media offers information on industry trends. Within the finance industry, companies use social media as a tool for analyzing market sentiment. These range from marketing financial products, market trends, and as a tool to identify insider trading.[84] To exploit these opportunities, businesses need guidelines for use on each platform.[3]

            Business use of social media is complicated by the fact that the business does not fully control its social media presence. Instead, it makes its case by participating in the "conversation".[85] Business uses social media[86] on a customer-organizational level; and an intra-organizational level.

            Social media can encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, by highlighting successes, and by easing access to resources that might not otherwise be readily available/known.[87]

            <h3>Marketing</h3>
            Main article: Social media marketing
            Social media marketing can help promote a product or service and establish connections with customers. Social media marketing can be divided into paid media, earned media, and owned media.[88] Using paid social media firms run advertising on a social media platform. Earned social media appears when firms do something that impresses stakeholders and they spontaneously post content about it. Owned social media is the platform markets itself by creating/promoting content to its users.[89]

            Primary uses are to create brand awareness, engage customers by conversation (e.g., customers provide feedback on the firm) and providing access to customer service.[90] Social media's peer-to-peer communication shifts power from the organization to consumers, since consumer content is widely visible and not controlled by the company.[91]

            Social media personalities, often referred to as "influencers", are Internet celebrities who are sponsored by marketers to promote products and companies online. Research reports that these endorsements attract the attention of users who have not settled on which products/services to buy,[92] especially younger consumers.[93] The practice of harnessing influencers to market or promote a product or service to their following is commonly referred to as influencer marketing.

            In 2013, the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) began advising celebrities to make it clear whether they had been paid to recommend a product or service by using the hashtag #spon or #ad when endorsing. The US Federal Trade Commission issued similar guidelines.[94]

            Social media platforms also enable targeting specific audiences with advertising. Users of social media can share, and comment on the advertisement, turning passive consumers into active promoters and even producers.[95] Targeting requires extra effort by advertisers to understand how to reach the right users.[3] Companies can use humor (such as shitposting) to poke fun at competitors.[96] Advertising can even inspire fanart which can engage new audiences.[97] Hashtags (such as #ejuice and #eliquid) are one way to target interested users.[98]

            User content can trigger peer effects, increasing consumer interest even without influencer involvement. A 2012 study focused on this communication reported that communication among peers can affect purchase intentions: direct impact through encouraging conformity, and an indirect impact by increasing product engagement. This study claimed that peer communication about a product increased product engagement.[99]

            <h3>Politics</h3>
            Main article: Social media use in politics
            See also: Social impact of YouTube, Use of social media in the Wisconsin protests, and Social media and political communication in the United States
            Social media have a range of uses in politics.[100] Politicians use social media to spread their messages and influence voters.[101]

            Dounoucos et al. reported that Twitter use by candidates was unprecedented during the US 2016 election.[102][103] The public increased its reliance on social-media sites for political information.[102] In the European Union, social media amplified political messages.[104] Foreign-originated social-media campaigns attempt to influence political opinion in another country.[105][106]

            <h3>Activism</h3>
            See also: Social media and the Arab Spring
            Social media was influential in the Arab Spring in 2011.[107][108][109][110] However, debate persists about the extent to which social media facilitated this.[111] Activists have used social media to report the abuse of human rights in Bahrain. They publicized the brutality of government authorities, who they claimed were detaining, torturing and threatening individuals. Conversely, Bahrain's government used social media to track and target activists. The government stripped citizenship from over 1,000 activists as punishment.[112]

            Militant groups use social media as an organizing and recruiting tool.[113] Islamic State (also known as ISIS) used social media. In 2014, #AllEyesonISIS went viral on Arabic
